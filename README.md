# U.S. Labor Structure Dashboard

This project explores **U.S. labor market trends** using official data from the **Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)**. The dashboard focuses on two key ideas:

1. **Unemployment Rate** – shows short-term labor market conditions
2. **Manufacturing’s Share of Employment** – shows long-term structural change in the economy

The goal is to provide a clear, simple view of how the U.S. labor market has evolved over time.

## 📊 What the Dashboard Shows

### 1. Unemployment Rate

* Monthly U.S. unemployment rate
* Users can choose a **start year** and **end year**
* The dashboard shows how many **percentage points** unemployment changed over that period

### 2. Manufacturing Share of Employment

* Calculates manufacturing employment as a share of total nonfarm payrolls
* Highlights the long-run decline of manufacturing jobs in the U.S.
* The calculation used is shown directly in the dashboard for transparency

---

## 🧮 How Manufacturing Share Is Calculated

Manufacturing Share (%) =

Manufacturing Employment ÷ Total Nonfarm Payrolls × 100

All values come directly from BLS employment series.



## 🎯 Purpose

This project is designed to:

* Demonstrate time-series analysis
* Show how different labor indicators relate to each other
* Provide a simple, interpretable economic dashboard using official government data

---

## 📝 Notes

* The unemployment rate reflects short-term economic conditions
* Manufacturing share highlights long-term structural change
* The dashboard separates these ideas to make interpretation clear and intuitive
